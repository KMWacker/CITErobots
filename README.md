This repository documents the STATA code for our "Estimating interaction effects with panel data" application to robotization and employment (with Chris Muris; chrismuris).

The code for the simulation study reported in the associated Journal of Applied Econometrics paper is available from my co-author here: https://github.com/chrismuris/CITE-simulation.
